All supported Ventilator setting with names and standard units. Anything with a ???
I was not sure about and has not yet been implemented

FiO2 [%] - The volume percent oxygen in the gas mixture the patient inhales
Maximum Inspired Flow [L/min] - Maximum amount of gas (INSPIRED?) by the patient
Inspired Tidal Volume [L] - Volume of air (DISPLACED?) by the patient for a (SINGLE INWARD BREATH?)
?Inspiratory Time [s??] - Time over which the ventilator forces in air into the patient's lungs
?Expiratory Time?? [s??] - Time over which the ventilator allows air to flow out of patient's lungs
SIMV [1/min] - Synchronized Intermmitent Mandatory Ventilation - the absolute minimum frequency of breaths, including patient-initiiated breaths
IPPV [1/min] - Intermittent positive pressure ventilation (UNCLEAR WHAT THIS IS)
PEEP [mbar] - Positive end-expiratory pressure - the pressure applied during expiration. Automatically falls below zero if patient attempts to initiate expiration.
CPAP [mbar] - Continuous Positive Airway Pressure - pressure applied continuously to keep airways open
?Intermittend(?) PEEP [mbar] - Unclear what this setting is
BIPAP High Pressure [mbar] - Pressure during high cycle of Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure
BIPAP Low Pressure [mbar] - Pressure during low cycle of Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure
BIPAP High Time [s] - Time during the high cycle of BIPAP
BIPAP Low Time [s] - Time spent in the low-pressure cycle of BIPAP
Apnea Time [s] - Amount of time after which patient is considered to have an apnea event???
?Assisted Spontaneous Breath [mbar] - ??? Trigger pressure to assume spontaneous breath is occuring?
Maximum Inspiratory Airway Pressure [mbar] - Maximum pressure to apply during inspiration 
?Trigger Pressure [mbar] - ???
Tachyapnea Frequency [1/min] - Frequency of apnea events after which a tachyapnea alarm is raised?
Tachyapnea Duration [sec] - Duration of a lack of airflow for it to be considered apnea?
?Flow Trigger [L/min] - ???
?ASB Ramp [s] - ???
?Flow Assist [mbar*s/L/10] - ???
?Volume Assist [mbar/L/10] - ???


Additional Derivable / Dependent Settings
IE Ratio [#] - Ratio of inspiratory time / expiratory time
Ti - Seems to be an shortening of inspiratory time
???ARPV High/Low Pressure - Airway Pressure Release Ventilation (looks like the same as BIPAP, just with different typical settings) http://rc.rcjournal.com/content/respcare/57/2/282.full.pdf
???ARPV High/Low Time - I believe same as BIPAP???
